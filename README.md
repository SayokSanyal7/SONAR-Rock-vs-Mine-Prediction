# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
Outwardly SONAR technique has exploited the discovery of rocks and minerals which would have been very difficult otherwise. The technique exploits certain parameters which will aid to detect the surface targets or obstacle such as a rock or a mine. Machine learning has drawn the attention of maximum part of todayâ€™s emerging technology, related from banking to many consumer and product based industries, by showing the advancements in the predictive analytics. This prediction can be done using machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression which is implemented in jupyter notebook.
